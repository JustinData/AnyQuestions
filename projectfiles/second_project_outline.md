# SECOND PROJECT OUTLINE

## PURPOSE

1. **Collaboration!**
   * Working as a member of a TEAM
   * Giving meaningful feedback on team members' work
   * Using Git for version control and GitHub for integrating work
   
2. **Agile Methodology**
	* Iterative development driven by meaningful User Stories
	* Integrating "user" (outside) advice into the development cycle
	* Working on ONE story at a time
	* Using a Scrum Board aka Pivotal Tracker to keep track of what work is being done and by whom
	* Daily Scrum / Stand up
	 
3. **Integrating the client-side and server-side of an application**
   * Working with multiple languages and libraries simultaneously
   * Learning about where to build logic (front-end or back-end)
   * Building software in an MVC manner that communicate via "interfaces" (ie, APIs)
   
## CORE REQUIREMENTS

These are the minimum requirements for your application. There is no getting around these, and you will not have approval to pitch a project that does not meet them. Meeting these requirements constitutes a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

#### 1. THE APPLICATION IS DEPLOYED

The application will be deployed and accessed on the Internet.

#### 2. THE APPLICATION HAS USER LOGIN AND AUTHORIZATION

The application needs to handle user login and sign up, and have more than one level of authorization (ie, roles). The simplest format for this is to implement both User and Admin roles for your application.

#### 3. THE APPLICATION PERSISTS DATA IN TABLES

There must be some form of data that is persisted on the server side. This need not be the focus of the application (for example, if the application pulls data from a third-party API or website and displays it), but it needs to both make sense for the purpose of the application AND not be stored in the user tables solely. There should be, at least, three tables for your application.

#### 4. THE APPLICATION HANDLES INVALID INPUT

Forms in your application should validate data on both the client-side with JavaScript and again on the back-end with Rails. Check data types, string lengths, formats, etc. Ensure that the data that is sent to the server or read from the server is meaningful and correctly formatted.

#### 5. THE APPLICATION IS DOCUMENTED

* ***README*** at the base of your GitHub repo for people looking at your code. Describe the project, the purpose, and an outline of how to read your repo.
* ***Splash Page*** and/or ***About Page(s)*** on your website, for users.

#### 6. WELL FORMATTED CODE

  * Best-practice Ruby style and JavaScript style (there are multiple style guides out there, but GitHub's is always good to follow: ([Ruby](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby), [JavaScript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript))
  * INDENTATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  * Comments where it will be useful to explain some bit of logic
  * Use `# TODO`s or `# FIXME`s to leave pertinent messages for team members or for future functionality

## TEAMS AND ROLES

You are a member of a team. We have created teams that we feel allow you to work with students you may not have had the chance to work with before, and in order to group students with complementary skill sets and approaches. Within your groups you should assign the following roles:

* **Project Manager**: Hosts the GitHub repo and deals with merging and deploying the team's codebase. Responsible for the README file and the consistency and formatting of the codebase (ie, for making each team member responsible for it :).
* **Design Lead**: Leads the wireframing and front-end development for your application. This person should not do ONLY front-end work. The "coding" should be evenly distributed among all teammates.

   * User Stories
   * A list of libraries you expect to use.
   * Defined team roles
* **Planning Documents** (Due Monday)
   * User Stories (in Pivotal Tracker)
   * Data Model (simple [ERD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model#Crow.27s_Foot_Notation) format)
   * Wireframes

## PRESENTATION

* You will present, as a group. You will present to us, the instructors, and we may invite other GA staff or instructors to take part.
* Presentation will consisit of a 3 minute demo followed by 5 - 10 minutes of questions from the instructor panel. You will be asked about the software design and implementation decisions you made, so pleased be prepared to defend them!
* **You will not present on your computer. You will present on either a MacBook running Safari 7, or on a Windows 7 PC running IE 10.** Which of thee two platforms you present on will be random.

## GOOD LUCK!
