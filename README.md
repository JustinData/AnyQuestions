### Concept
Classroom tool for students to ask questions without interupting the instructor.  Questions are updated in real time allowing other students to upvote any questions they also have.  Questions will sort by most common among the students.  The instructor will be able to quickly and more accurately gauge how well the class understands the material, and adjust the lesson accordingly.
* Student ask questions.
* Students vote for questions they share.
* Questions, votes, and sorting update in real time.
* Instructor can be notified if a question reaches a certain threshold of votes.

* AJAX/JSON


####Recent Updates and Status
* Frontend plugins from original projects have been removed. (Packery and Wheel-Menu)
* Simple login page implemented for development.
