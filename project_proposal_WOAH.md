WOAH!
===
WOAH! is a simple classroom tool to keep a real time tally of subjects and concepts that students are having a hard time grasping.  It facilitates the teacher reviewing subjects, supports annonymous questioning/flagging, and allows students an opportunity to help their peers grapple with new concepts.

##Pros and Cons

| *Pros* | *Cons* |
|------|------|
|Websockets are cool! | Websockets are hard! |
|Useable application | The ui for the students and teachers is really different |
|We can get feedback from target users, internal & external | Potentially complicated interface between teachers/students/and questions|
|Good opportunity to practice AGILE/MVP stategies to develop useful user stories | Not "winterfresh"|
| Exciting industry (EdTech) | Lots of competition - how does it stand out? |
